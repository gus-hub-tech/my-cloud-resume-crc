## Project Overview

This repository contains the source code for a personal resume website, designed as a cloud project following the [Cloud Resume Challenge (CRC)](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/). The site presents your resume in an interactive and visually appealing format, leveraging cloud technologies for deployment and scalability.

## Components
- Static Website Hosting**: Serves all frontend files (`index.html`, CSS, JS, assets) from a cloud storage bucket.
- Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JS for the interactive resume.
- Serverless Backend (Optional)**: API Gateway + Lambda function(s) (Python, in `backend/`) for features like the visitor counter.
- Database (Optional)**: E.g., DynamoDB to store and retrieve the visitor count.



## Features

- Responsive and modern design
- Showcases professional experience, education, and skills
- Live project links and contact information
- Cloud-friendly structure for easy deployment (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage)
- Optionally includes a visitor counter (using serverless backend)

## Tech Stack

- **HTML**: Structure and layout (66%)
- **CSS**: Styling and responsive design (26.2%)
- **JavaScript**: Interactive features (2.4%)
- **Python**: Backend/serverless functionality (5.4%)  
  (e.g., API for visitor counter or contact form)

## Getting Started

## Deployment

You can deploy this site to popular cloud platforms. Here are some options:

### Deploy to AWS S3 (Static Website Hosting)

1. Build/prepare your site
2. Upload files to your S3 bucket
3. Enable static website hosting
4. (Optional) Set up a custom domain with Route 53

### Serverless Backend (Optional)

If using a visitor counter or contact form:

- Deploy Python Lambda functions (see `/backend`)
- Use API Gateway to expose endpoints
- Connect frontend JavaScript to the API
